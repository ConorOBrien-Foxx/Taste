# Taste

Taste is an esoteric language whose operators are defined on the bit scale.

## Language Features

Taste comes with two interpreters which should function the same: [A webpage](./index.html) and a [REPL that runs in `node.js`](./taste.node.js).

## Compilation

To compile Taste, you need the [Elm compiler](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html). Then, you can run [`./compile.bat`](./compile.bat) (for Windows) or [`./compile.sh`](./compile.sh) (for most other systems).
